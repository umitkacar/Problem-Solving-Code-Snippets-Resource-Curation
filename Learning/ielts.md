    },

    "pro_tips": [
        "Always attempt all questions",
        "No negative marking",
        "Educated guesses are fine",
        "Transfer answers carefully - NO extra time!"

    style D fill:#e74c3c,stroke:#c0392b,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

#### True/False/Not Given Strategy

| Answer | Meaning | How to Identify |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **TRUE** | Statement agrees with passage | Exact match or paraphrase |
| **FALSE** | Statement contradicts passage | Opposite meaning found |
| **NOT GIVEN** | No information in passage | Missing from text entirely |

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Using outside knowledge
- ❌ Making assumptions
- ❌ Mixing up False and Not Given

**Pro Tips:**
- ✅ Scan for keywords first
- ✅ Look for paraphrasing
- ✅ If unsure between False/NG → usually NOT GIVEN

#### Sample Task 1 Response (Band 8)

```
The line graph illustrates the changes in the consumption of three types of meat (chicken,
beef, and lamb) in a European country between 1979 and 2004.

Overall, chicken consumption experienced a dramatic rise over the period, while beef and lamb
showed declining trends. By 2004, chicken had become the most popular meat, overtaking both
beef and lamb.

In 1979, beef was the most consumed meat at approximately 220 grams per person per week,
compared to around 150 grams for lamb and just under 150 grams for chicken. Over the next
decade, beef consumption peaked at roughly 240 grams in 1983 before beginning a steady
decline to about 100 grams by 2004.

Conversely, chicken consumption showed a markedly different pattern, rising consistently
throughout the entire period from 150 grams to peak at approximately 250 grams in 2004.
Meanwhile, lamb consumption followed a downward trajectory, falling gradually from 150 grams
to around 60 grams per person per week by the end of the period.
